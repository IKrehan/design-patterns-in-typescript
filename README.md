# Design Patterns in TypeScript 🛠

Currently I'm studying Design Patterns and implementing examples of them to have a better understanding. This repository is a way for me to share the material i'm creating with anyone that may have interest in it.


## Executing the examples 💻

Install the dependencies with:

```
yarn
```

To run the examples the cli should be used, each option will run the example associated with the pattern that names it.

```
yarn start

? Choose one of the following patterns to run. (Use arrow keys)
❯ Strategy
  Observer
  ...
```
