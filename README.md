# Design Patterns in TypeScript 🛠

Currently I'm studying Design Patterns and implementing examples of them to have a better understanding. This repository is a way for me to share the material i'm creating with anyone that may have interest in it.


### Documentation 📚

A documentation explaining the patterns and the implementation of each example can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Design-Patterns-c2bdb756a38d44388a990b5367123177).


### Executing the examples 💻

Install the dependencies with:

```
yarn
```

To run the examples you can use one of these scripts, each script will run the example associated with the pattern that names it.

```
yarn observer
yarn strategy
```
